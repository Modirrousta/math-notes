    <p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>his bicentennial year marks an appropriate occasion to reflect on Riemann’s relationship with Gauss. Intellectually, Gauss and Cauchy laid the groundwork for the study of complex functions and their integrals, whereas Riemann set forth a far broader theory in his doctoral dissertation, written in 1851 under the formal supervision of Gauss. [cite_start]This raises an obvious question, namely, how closely did Gauss supervise Riemann’s dissertation? [cite: 21-23]. [cite_start]Put more broadly, does it make any sense to view Gauss as Riemann’s mentor?[cite: 24]. [cite_start]To answer that simple question, this essay undertakes a journey back to mid-nineteenth-century Göttingen, an era that preceded the rise of modern mathematical research schools[cite: 25].</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    
    [cite_start]<p>Bernhard Riemann (Fig. 1), whose name and legacy have long been identified with that of Göttingen University, occupies a special place in the annals of modern mathematics[cite: 27]. [cite_start]He has often been coupled with the even more famous Carl Friedrich Gauss (Fig. 2), who came to Göttingen in 1807 as a professional astronomer[cite: 28]. [cite_start]Gauss broke into that field by inventing his method of least squares, followed by relocating the asteroid Ceres on the basis of just three observations[cite: 29]. [cite_start]As director of the Göttingen Observatory, he gained the admiration of the scientific world for his work in astronomy, geodesy, terrestrial magnetism, and pure mathematics[cite: 30]. [cite_start]By the 1830s, he and the von Humboldt brothers (Alexander and Wilhelm) were among the most influential academics in Germany[cite: 31].</p>

    </figure>

    [cite_start]<p>Riemann was one of Gauss’s very last students, though their relationship was hardly close[cite: 32]. [cite_start]Mentorship can take many forms, of course, but the title of this essay raises the issue of whether that term should even be applied in this special case[cite: 33]. [cite_start]In looking back on the life and work of Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866) in this bicentennial year, it may seem surprising that this simple question could still be asked[cite: 34]. [cite_start]But, of course, the answer depends on what one means by the verb “to mentor”[cite: 35]. [cite_start]As understood in today’s world, I think we can clearly answer in the negative[cite: 36].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>This leaves, however, a larger and more perplexing question, namely, what precisely was the nature of Gauss’s influence on Riemann?[cite: 37]. [cite_start]In this essay I will only broach that difficult subject by way of a few examples, while otherwise leaving this as an open question[cite: 38]. [cite_start]Part of the mystery surrounding Riemann’s mathematics involves the debts he owed to other mathematicians, whose works he only rarely cited[cite: 39]. [cite_start]He may at times have consciously suppressed such information, but in those days authors were not expected to diligently acknowledge their sources[cite: 40]. [cite_start]In Riemann’s case, we know that he was a voracious reader all his life; moreover, he immersed himself in the works and ideas of Gauss from the time he first entered the university[cite: 41, 42]. [cite_start]Riemann thereafter occasionally interacted with Gauss; sometimes he even imagined himself competing with him, particularly in mathematical studies of electricity and magnetism[cite: 43]. [cite_start]Nevertheless, despite their close physical proximity, Gauss’s actual influence on Riemann was rather akin to an action-at-a-distance force[cite: 44].</p>

    </figure>

    [cite_start]<p>According to the Mathematics Genealogy Project (MGP), Gauss had fifteen students, one of whom was Bernhard Riemann[cite: 45]. The MGP data suggests that over one-third of the more than 300,000 mathematicians listed were academic descendants of C.F. [cite_start]Gauss[cite: 46]. [cite_start]The line running through Riemann contributes about 4,000 descendants to Gauss’s list[cite: 47]. [cite_start]This count is based on the assumption that he had two students, one of whom, the Norwegian Carl Anton Bjerknes, supposedly was mathematically related to Élie Cartan through Sophus Lie (though Cartan never studied in Leipzig)[cite: 48]. [cite_start]Bjerknes briefly studied under Riemann and Gustav Dirichlet in Göttingen, but he did not remain to take a doctorate there[cite: 49]. [cite_start]It seems likely that the correct number of Riemann’s doctoral students should be zero[cite: 50].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>Such data counts, no matter how carefully done, are bound to be misleading in a number of ways[cite: 51]. [cite_start]Clearly, they provide a meaningful way to gauge the size and spread of research schools, starting around 1950[cite: 52]. [cite_start]Mentoring in the modern sense of the word dates back earlier, to be sure, though to judge by the recently expressed views of Bernd Sturmfels and Ken Ono, it remains far more an art than a science[cite: 52]. [cite_start]However, extrapolating back even further, to the mid-nineteenth century, is fraught with problems that require careful treatment of quantitative information [cite: 53-54].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>Historically, the roots of modern mathematical research schools date back to earlier traditions, as described by Bill Clark in his lighthearted study[cite: 55]. [cite_start]Mathematics provides a particularly compelling case, owing to the crucial importance of charismatic individuals[cite: 56]. [cite_start]The mystique associated with an influential Doktorvater or, more recently, Doktormutter, as the informal head of a research school has had a long and lasting appeal, even though these lineages tell us rather little about actual intellectual influence in higher mathematics[cite: 57]. [cite_start]In point of fact, mathematical research schools only really began to emerge in a clear form during the last third of the nineteenth century[cite: 58]. [cite_start]They were not yet a recognizable part of the mathematical world Bernhard Riemann knew and in which he moved[cite: 59]. [cite_start]What is more, doctoral studies and mentoring had a very different character in Riemann’s day[cite: 60]. [cite_start]Here, what I mainly hope to illuminate concerns the academic world of Göttingen during the brief period when the world lines of Gauss and Riemann crossed[cite: 61].</p>

    <h2>2. Riemann’s Student Years, 1846–1851</h2>
    
    [cite_start]<p>Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann was the second of six children born to a Lutheran pastor and his wife, who came from a distinguished family in Hanover[cite: 67]. [cite_start]Their children grew up in a church vicarage located in the village of Quickborn, still today part of a remote region in northern Germany lying west of the Elbe River[cite: 68]. [cite_start]Bernhard’s father had studied theology in Göttingen and had high hopes his son would eventually follow in his footsteps[cite: 69]. [cite_start]As with all the children in the Riemann family, Bernhard was tutored at home by his father[cite: 70]. [cite_start]Then, after his confirmation at age thirteen, he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother in Hanover, where he attended a local Gymnasium[cite: 71]. [cite_start]When she passed away in 1842, Riemann transferred to another classical Gymnasium in Lüneburg, which was much closer to the family home[cite: 72]. [cite_start]He experienced many difficulties at this school, but he also had the good luck that his mathematics teacher, a man named Constantin Schmalfuss, discovered his extraordinary abilities[cite: 73].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>One sometimes reads (e.g., in Wikipedia) that Gauss convinced Riemann to drop his theological studies in Göttingen in order to take up mathematics instead[cite: 74]. [cite_start]If such a conversation actually had taken place, I would be happy to concede that Gauss deserved to be called "Riemann’s mentor," but of course that would require real evidence, not just a legendary story[cite: 75]. [cite_start]It is far more plausible that Riemann had no meaningful interactions with Gauss during his first year of study[cite: 76]. [cite_start]Immediately afterward, he left to study mathematics in Berlin, which had a far more advanced curriculum than the one he found in Göttingen[cite: 77]. [cite_start]It is true that Riemann originally enrolled in theology as a concession to his father, but Pastor Riemann already knew long before that his son wanted nothing more than to study higher mathematics, and he thankfully granted him that wish[cite: 78].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>Riemann’s mentor at this early stage was Schmalfuss, who also happened to be director of the Lüneburg Gymnasium[cite: 79]. In his final year there, Riemann wrote home to his father:</p>

    <blockquote>
        [cite_start]I now feel more and more desire and inclination towards mathematics, and Schmalfuss also seems to be of the opinion that I should study mathematics; of course, for the sake of the scholarship alone, I would register for the exam here as a theologian and enroll in theology in Göttingen, but I have to decide for myself what I should actually do there, because otherwise I won’t be able to achieve anything respectable in any subject. [cite: 81-82]
    </blockquote>

    [cite_start]<p>Graduates leaving a classical Gymnasium with the Abitur—the certificate bestowed on those who passed the grueling final comprehensive examinations—were generally allowed to study any field at any German university[cite: 84]. [cite_start]Despite the fact that these universities had their own individual statutes, while being administered by the various German states, they were remarkably uniform in several respects[cite: 85]. [cite_start]Their academic calendar was based on two semesters separated by two religious holidays[cite: 86]. [cite_start]Winter semesters began usually two weeks after Michaelmas (St. Michael’s Day, September 29) and ended in the spring, shortly before Easter[cite: 87]. [cite_start]The break before the summer semester started was roughly one month long, after which the lecture period ran from April to August[cite: 88].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>Many students chose to attend more than one institution, as transferring involved only minimal administrative paperwork[cite: 89]. [cite_start]Another shared feature of these universities made this process even simpler: there were no course grades or any requirements to take tests or turn in written assignments[cite: 90]. [cite_start]This radical form of <em>Lernfreiheit</em> (freedom to learn) could easily be abused, and of course often was; yet for those with a thirst for knowledge, this system gave a highly select group of young men an unusual opportunity to explore new ideas, but also to sink if they didn’t learn how to swim quickly [cite: 91-92]. [cite_start]For Riemann, whose letters to his family reveal that he dreaded the regimentation of Gymnasium routine, these refreshing university waters must have seemed like an academic paradise[cite: 93].</p>

        [cite_start]<figcaption><strong>Figure 3.</strong> The Göttingen Seven: above, the Brothers Grimm, below, left to right, Wilhelm Weber and Heinrich Ewald[cite: 95].</figcaption>
    </figure>

    [cite_start]<p>Gauss came from the era of royal courts and their patrons, a milieu that gave him a very different perspective[cite: 97]. [cite_start]He already enjoyed a spectacularly productive career when, between 1830 and 1837, he entered into a highly fruitful collaboration with the physicist Wilhelm Weber[cite: 98]. [cite_start]Then, in that fateful year of 1837, everything suddenly changed[cite: 99]. [cite_start]Hanover fell out of the personal union with Great Britain following Queen Victoria’s ascension to the throne[cite: 100]. [cite_start]The new Hanoverian King, Ernst August, immediately annulled the relatively liberal constitution his predecessor had introduced a few years earlier[cite: 101]. [cite_start]As civil servants, the members of Göttingen’s faculty had sworn their allegiance to that constitution, and several felt bound by their oaths[cite: 102].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>Seven of the more eminent among them openly protested the King’s decision, including Weber and Gauss’s son-in-law Heinrich Ewald (Fig. 3)[cite: 103]. [cite_start]The King responded by dismissing all seven from their academic positions and expelling the three he regarded as the ringleaders of the "Göttingen Seven" from his land[cite: 104]. [cite_start]Many wondered why Gauss remained silent, as insiders knew he was deeply disappointed about these dismissals, but he refused to bite the hand that fed him, knowing that even he was a mere Hofrat—a court adviser, whose advice was rarely ever sought and certainly not during a contentious political confrontation [cite: 105-106].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>In the wake of this incident, enrollments fell dramatically[cite: 107]. [cite_start]Throughout the 1820s, they had hovered around 1400, but by the time Riemann arrived in April 1846, the number of students had fallen to 560, and very few of these had come to study mathematics, despite the presence of Gauss on the faculty[cite: 107]. [cite_start]As an incoming student, Riemann surely had no picture of the steep decline in numbers as well as in morale that the university had suffered in the wake of the "Göttingen Seven" debacle[cite: 108].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>During this era, Göttingen University still had only four faculties, a structure dating back to the Middle Ages[cite: 109]. [cite_start]These were the traditional higher faculties—theology, jurisprudence, and medicine—plus the philosophical faculty, which was far larger than the other three[cite: 110]. [cite_start]Only the full professors (Ordinarien) were entitled to manage the internal affairs of their respective faculties[cite: 111]. [cite_start]In many cases, these were older men who held the honorific title of Hofrat (Court Councilor)[cite: 112]. [cite_start]Within this group, Hofrat Gauss was rightfully held in the highest esteem, but he confined his teaching to topics in astronomy and geodesy[cite: 113]. [cite_start]Taken together, Göttingen had 37 Ordinarien in 1846: its theology faculty had five, the law faculty six, the medical faculty nine, and the philosophy faculty seventeen[cite: 114].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>It should be noted that students who officially enrolled in a course paid a fee directly to the instructor[cite: 116]. [cite_start]They could enroll in up to six courses, and often did so after attending on a trial basis[cite: 117]. [cite_start]Riemann’s interests were so broad that he had great difficulty in deciding which six courses to take[cite: 118]. [cite_start]During his first year in Göttingen, he took mathematics courses offered by Gauss (method of least squares) and Moritz Abraham Stern (definite integrals), as well as a course on geomagnetism taught by Gauss’s protégé, Benjamin Goldschmidt[cite: 119]. [cite_start]Otherwise, Riemann took a broad range of courses in Göttingen, whereas during his second and third years of study in Berlin he concentrated almost exclusively on mathematics and physics[cite: 120].</p>

    <p>Riemann learned a great deal about cutting-edge research in higher mathematics from courses taught in Berlin by Gustav Dirichlet, C.G.J. [cite_start]Jacobi, and Gotthold Eisenstein [cite: 121-122]. [cite_start]He also studied under the meteorologist Heinrich Dove and the astronomer Franz Encke[cite: 122]. [cite_start]When not attending lectures, Riemann was often in the library studying the latest literature, including several French publications[cite: 123]. [cite_start]He was especially interested in Cauchy’s pioneering studies of complex functions and their integrals[cite: 124]. [cite_start]Most of all, though, he continued to undertake a close study of Gauss’s works[cite: 125]. [cite_start]This reinforced his growing interest in potential theory in the tradition of Gauss and Dirichlet[cite: 126].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>On returning to Göttingen in 1849, Riemann’s interests turned toward physics and philosophy[cite: 127]. [cite_start]He enrolled in the teaching seminar and the new mathematics and physics seminar initiated by Stern in 1850. The courses taught by Heinrich Ritter and Hermann Lotze helped deepen his interests in metaphysics and methodology in the natural sciences[cite: 128]. [cite_start]He also found the courses taught by the chemist Friedrich Wöhler highly rewarding[cite: 129]. [cite_start]Weber had in the meantime been reappointed to the faculty, a happy turn of events for Riemann, both scientifically and personally[cite: 130]. [cite_start]Indeed, Wilhelm Weber and the geologist Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen, both of whom were on intimate terms with Gauss, later helped arrange the financing that enabled Riemann to spend most of his time in Italy during the last years of his life[cite: 131].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>After taking his doctorate in Göttingen in 1847, Quintus-Icilius habilitated under Weber in 1849[cite: 133]. [cite_start]Thereafter, he worked as Weber’s Assistent at the Physics Institute, where he surely interacted with Riemann on a regular basis[cite: 133]. [cite_start]In recounting Riemann’s career, it is important to realize that many young men took doctoral degrees[cite: 134]. [cite_start]To qualify for a regular academic position at a German university, however, those who held doctorates were required to habilitate, a procedure entrusted to members of the philosophical faculty[cite: 135]. [cite_start]In Riemann’s day, this rite of passage amounted to gaining admission into a small club, as the entire philosophical faculty in Göttingen had fewer than twenty full professors[cite: 136]. [cite_start]After Riemann gained his doctorate, Gauss also took charge of his Habilitation, which Riemann completed only months before the "Prince of Mathematicians" died in February 1855[cite: 137].</p>

    <h2>3. Riemann’s Promotion to Dr. Phil.</h2>
    
    [cite_start]<p>The doctorate (Dr. Phil. being the forerunner of the modern PhD) had long been conferred by the higher faculties—theology, law, and medicine—whereas the propaedeutic arts and philosophy faculty only issued the masters title[cite: 140]. [cite_start]Göttingen broke with that tradition, beginning with the career of Christian Gottlob Heyne[cite: 141]. [cite_start]A prolific expert on Greek mythology, Heyne served as professor for poetry and eloquence from 1763 until his death in 1812[cite: 142]. [cite_start]It was during this time that the Dr. Phil. degree first took hold in Göttingen[cite: 143]. [cite_start]Over the last three decades of the eighteenth century, forty students received the Dr. Phil.[cite: 144]. [cite_start]In four cases, the candidate submitted a dissertation in mathematics[cite: 145].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>By the early decades of the next century, the number of doctoral degrees grew, though some were conferred without a dissertation[cite: 147]. [cite_start]When this occurred, the candidate was promoted on the basis of his performance in a public dispute[cite: 148]. [cite_start]Normally, though, the first step toward gaining the title of Dr. Phil. involved submitting a dissertation, usually around 50 pages, that purported to constitute original research [cite: 150-151]. [cite_start]Let us now consider the special case of the Studiosus Bernhard Riemann, whose dissertation was entitled (in English translation) "Foundations of a General Theory of Functions of a Variable Complex Quantity"[cite: 153].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>On November 14, 1851, Riemann applied to the dean of the philosophical faculty to be admitted to take the final oral exams for his doctorate[cite: 154]. [cite_start]Beside his dissertation, he also submitted a formal letter of application and his curriculum vita; both of these documents were composed in Latin as stipulated by the faculty [cite: 155-156]. [cite_start]The presiding dean was the oriental philologist Heinrich Ewald, who had married Gauss’s daughter Minna[cite: 157]. The day after he received Riemann’s documents, Ewald wrote to inform the full professors on the faculty:</p>

    <blockquote>
        I hereby put before my distinguished colleagues the treatise of a new candidate for our doctorate, Mr. B. Riemann from Breselenz; and entreat Court Councilor Gauss for an opinion on the latter and, if it proves to be satisfactory, for an appropriate indication of the day and the hour when the oral examination could be held. The candidate wants to be examined in mathematics and physics. [cite_start]The Latin in the request and the vita is clumsy and scarcely endurable: however, outside the philological sciences, one can hardly expect at present anything better... [cite: 160-163]
    </blockquote>

    [cite_start]<p>On 24 November, Bernhard wrote to his younger brother Wilhelm about where matters stood[cite: 166]. [cite_start]In the meantime, Gauss had read Riemann’s dissertation and reported on it[cite: 167]. [cite_start]He also learned that all the other faculty members had signed off, so the dean had now set the oral exam for Monday, December 1[cite: 168]. [cite_start]Riemann also reported on some enigmatic remarks from a recent conversation he had with Gauss[cite: 168]:</p>

    <blockquote>
        When I was with Gauss on Saturday, he had not yet read my treatise, but told me that he had been preparing a paper for years (and was working on it right now), the subject of which was the same, or at least partly the same, as the one I had dealt with. He had indeed already indicated in his doctoral dissertation 52 years ago that he intended to write about this subject. [cite_start]I have not yet heard his opinion of my work...however, I must conclude from the comments of the others... that he was satisfied with my work. [cite: 170-172]
    </blockquote>

    [cite_start]<p>Evidently, Riemann had the opportunity to speak with a few of the faculty members who had seen Gauss’s brief report, which surely left him much relieved before taking the oral[cite: 174]. [cite_start]Although written without guidance from Gauss, Riemann’s dissertation was nevertheless heavily indebted to him[cite: 175]. [cite_start]In it, he referred to two works—on conformal mappings and the intrinsic geometry of surfaces—both of great importance for the theory of Riemann surfaces [cite: 176-177].</p>

    <p>Indeed, Gauss approved Riemann’s dissertation with the following brief assessment:</p>

    <blockquote>
        The paper submitted by Mr. Riemann bears conclusive evidence of the profound and penetrating studies of the author in the area to which the topic dealt with belongs, of a diligent, genuinely mathematical spirit of research, and of a laudable and productive independence. The presentation is circumspect and concise, in part even elegant: yet the majority of readers might well wish in some parts a still greater transparency of arrangement. [cite_start]The whole is a worthy and valuable work... [cite: 183-185]
    </blockquote>

    [cite_start]<p>Gauss was often stingy with praise, so these few words spoke volumes, even if he said nothing whatsoever about the content of the dissertation[cite: 187]. [cite_start]As Gauss anticipated, most readers found Riemann’s dissertation very difficult, partly due to its novelty[cite: 189]. [cite_start]The text gave a new definition of analytic functions and described their fundamental properties in terms of Riemann surfaces, derived their existence by means of what he later called Dirichlet’s principle, and ended by giving a proof of the Riemann mapping theorem[cite: 190]. [cite_start]In short, it was an astoundingly original piece of work in a virtually new field, complex analysis[cite: 191].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>Riemann’s far more flexible conception utilized a connected surface lying over the plane so that for any point in the plane, except for branch points, the number of leaves above it agrees with the number of function values[cite: 195]. [cite_start]These leaves then join each other at the branch points forming a connected surface that corresponds to the determinations of the function[cite: 196]. [cite_start]In the closing sections of his dissertation, Riemann only alluded to this general conception, while promising to develop it on another occasion[cite: 197]. [cite_start]It took him another six years to deliver on that promise with the publication of his monumental study on Abelian functions[cite: 198].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>The letter from 24 November, cited earlier, makes clear that Gauss had taken no part in advising Riemann on his dissertation topic, nor would such mentoring have conformed with the norms of that day[cite: 199]. [cite_start]As the Dean had requested, Gauss suggested possible times for the oral, and these met with the approval of the other signatories[cite: 207]. [cite_start]This group of nine represented half of the full faculty, and its membership was apparently based on seniority alone[cite: 208].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>The oral examinations were now to be held on December 3, after which Riemann assumed he would go home to celebrate with his family[cite: 210]. [cite_start]He had applied for dispensation from the venerable custom of defending theses in a public dispute, but he soon learned that his plea had been refused[cite: 211]. On 13 December, he vented his anger over this in a letter to Wilhelm:</p>

    <blockquote>
        [cite_start]Unfortunately, I have had to deal with a dean (Professor Ewald) for my doctorate who is a terrible pedant and troublemaker... Now he is demanding a public disputation, even though this has not taken place in the philosophical faculty for ten years....I have agreed to do so, in order to avoid further delays... [cite: 213-216]
    </blockquote>

    [cite_start]<p>Riemann’s outrage over this was somewhat misplaced, as Ewald was merely behaving as an upstanding public official who saw no possibility of evading the statutory requirements[cite: 217]. [cite_start]Moreover, Gauss had independently reached the same conclusion[cite: 218]. [cite_start]Only Weber had favored granting Riemann dispensation from the formal dispute[cite: 218]. [cite_start]Gauss, however, was unmoved: "Without a disputation, a doctor is no real doctor"[cite: 221].</p>

    <h2>4. Riemann’s Disputation</h2>
    
    [cite_start]<p>Riemann probably never did learn that Gauss had cast the key vote that quashed his petition, nor is it likely that anyone will some day discover the name(s) of his opponent(s) in the disputation that took place on 16 December, an ordeal he managed to get through[cite: 225]. [cite_start]Since no record of what transpired during Riemann’s disputation survives, what actually happened that day is largely (though not entirely) left to our imagination[cite: 226].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>Initially, it seems Riemann planned to propose six theses he was prepared to defend in the formal dispute[cite: 228]. [cite_start]It is noteworthy that no fewer than five of these dealt with physical topics, reflecting Riemann’s highly critical views of various current ideas [cite: 229-230]:
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>(1) Magnetic fluids do not exist[cite: 231].</li>
        [cite_start]<li>(2) Faraday’s "induction in curved lines" is untenable[cite: 232].</li>
        [cite_start]<li>(3) A reversible pendulum is not the best means for determining the length of a seconds pendulum[cite: 233].</li>
        [cite_start]<li>(4) The theory of conservation of force has not been sufficiently proved experimentally[cite: 234].</li>
        [cite_start]<li>(5) The concept of voltage in the theory of electricity has not yet been formulated sharply enough[cite: 235].</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    </figure>

    [cite_start]<p>Riemann may have discussed these with Weber, with whom he worked closely[cite: 239]. [cite_start]In any case, Riemann’s estate in Göttingen contains a draft of three Latin propositions for a disputation, all of which concern the properties of a complex analytic function[cite: 241]. [cite_start]Another document in Riemann’s papers makes it quite certain that these propositions were, indeed, those he defended in his disputation[cite: 242]. [cite_start]The text translated below is taken from a transcription prepared by Richard Dedekind (Fig. 4)[cite: 245]:</p>

    <blockquote>
        The treatise I wrote for my doctorate... was not written with polemical intent. [cite_start]However, since it is also intended to provide material for the current debate, it will be appropriate to highlight some points from it where men of recognized reputation have set forth contrary claims. [cite: 247-249]
    </blockquote>

    [cite_start]<p>The first point concerns the definition of the term "function of a complex variable"[cite: 250]. [cite_start]In order to make clear that this was an essentially new conception, Riemann named two opposing definitions of a complex function: First, a function $w$ of a variable quantity $z=x+yi$ is attributed the property that $dw/dz$ is independent of $dz$[cite: 255]. [cite_start]Second, one considers a complex quantity $w$ as a function that varies with $z=x+yi$ but in any arbitrary way[cite: 258]. [cite_start]This view was expressed by Cauchy, who among the French was the first to deal extensively with the theory of complex quantities[cite: 259].</p>

    [cite_start]<p>Summarizing the formalities in this case, it emerges that Gauss was, indeed, the key figure[cite: 275]. [cite_start]He acted, however, in concert with a standing doctoral committee within the philosophical faculty[cite: 276]. [cite_start]Riemann met the faculty’s requirements for the Dr. Phil. by submitting an acceptable piece of written work, passing an oral exam in mathematics and physics, and performing before the academic public in a modified form of a traditional Latin dispute [cite: 281-282]. [cite_start]The degree he thereby earned, on the other hand, was little more than a badge of honor[cite: 283]. [cite_start]Those, like Riemann, who wished to become candidates for teaching at a German university had to go through yet another ordeal, the procedure known as Habilitation[cite: 284].</p>
    
    [cite_start]<p>Unlike his doctoral thesis, Riemann’s postdoctoral dissertation was only published posthumously[cite: 287]. [cite_start]When he submitted his thesis to the faculty, Gauss was again asked to report on it[cite: 289]. [cite_start]This time, Gauss chose to express himself even more tersely, writing: "The present treatise contains so many evidences of fine knowledge, good assessment and self-capable skill that it is completely sufficient for its purpose"[cite: 290]. [cite_start]As for Riemann’s lecture, Gauss famously requested that he speak "On the Hypotheses which lie at the Bases of Geometry"[cite: 291]. [cite_start]Afterward, Wilhelm Weber remembered that Gauss spoke enthusiastically about the text Riemann read to a small group of professors the day he habilitated[cite: 292].</p>
